## snakeGame

The game of Snake is my "Hello World" equivalent.  My quest is to create this game in every programming language I know, or to die trying.  I guess, preferrably the latter.

Here is an example using mostly js and JQuery, hosted in Rails.

##stack/features

1. Jquery powered, using HTML 5 canvas.
2. private javascript object with public api to prevent cheating.
3. rails testing with Rspec
4. javascript testing with Jasmine

##planned features
1. replace blue blocks with rounded blocks/images
2. replace food blocks with custom image
3. round body segments, 360-degree movement instead of 4-directional.
4. Rails 4 -- when it's available
5. sounds, intro and styling.
6. enhance keyboard control for play/pause.
7. user accounts with score keeping
9. auto-pilot/bot.  kinda prerequisite for #8.
8. multiplayer mode....contact server through ajax to update your position, query server for opponent's position.
